Amruta's Personal Portfolio
A modern, responsive, and dynamic personal portfolio built with React to showcase my skills, projects, and educational background. This website serves as a central hub to demonstrate my abilities in front-end and full-stack web development.

Features
About Me: A professional introduction and summary of my skills.

Education: A detailed breakdown of my academic background.

Projects: A dynamic, filterable gallery of my personal and academic projects.

Blog: A section to share insights and learnings from my projects.

Contact: A contact form and links to my professional profiles.

Dark Mode: A modern, easy-on-the-eyes dark theme for a better user experience.

Technologies Used
This project is built as a single-page application using the React framework and leverages a suite of modern web technologies.

Frontend:

React: The core library for building the user interface.

React Router: Manages client-side routing, enabling seamless navigation between different sections (/, /portfolio, /blog, /contact) without page reloads. This is configured in App.js.

JavaScript: Powers the interactive components and state management, as seen in Portfolio.js (for project filtering) and Profile.js.

HTML & CSS: The foundation for the website's structure and styling. The app uses a global stylesheet (App.css) to define a dark mode theme with CSS variables, as well as specific stylesheets for each component (Profile.css, Portfolio.css, etc.) for modular styling.

Project Dependencies:

Node.js: The runtime environment used for development and to run the build process.

npm: The package manager for installing project dependencies.
